Hello there! If you're on this page, that means you are here to download/update Dean (or you're just snooping through my github idk) If you are unfamiliar with ghosts, there are some amazing guides on the wiki, here's the link to the beginner guide if you're interested: https://ukagakadreamteam.com/wiki/guide/beginner_guide .

If there are any issues please let me know! In addition, if there are quotes or interactions that you would like added, feel free to message me, I might be willing to add them.
