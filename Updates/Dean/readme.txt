--Readme--

Hey there, thank you for downloading Dean Winchester! I'm YudiDoodles, the person who made this ghost, using the template made by the amazing Zarla.
While Dean is open on your desktop, he will randomly say quotes from Supernatural. To open his menu, double click on his body. From this menu, you can choose to type in things to say to him (not everything has a unique response), and give him things if you would like. You can pet him by mousing over his face, although if you don't have very high friendship he'll get mad. You can tell if what you did raised friendship by whether a plus sign and heart appear next to him when he responds. 
His main hotkeys are 't' to have him say something random, 'r' to have him repeat what he just said, 'v' to reset him (this will run his startup dialogue and options again as well), and 'f1' to open this readme.
